        Why does the sun go on shining?
        Why does the sea rush to shore?
        Don't they know it's the end of the world?
       'Cause you don't love me any more

        I wake-up in the morning, and I wonder
        Why everything's the same as it was
        I can't understand, no, I can't understand
        How life goes on the way it does
